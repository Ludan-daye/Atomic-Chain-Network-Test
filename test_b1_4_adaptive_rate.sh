echo "-------------------------------"

echo "1. Normal enhanced discovery (should include adaptive rate simulation):"
echo "netcrate-simple discover --enhanced 192.168.0.0/22"
./netcrate-simple discover --enhanced 192.168.0.0/22 2>&1 | head -25

echo
echo "‚úÖ B1-4 Tests completed!"
echo
echo "Expected behaviors:"
echo "- Enhanced discovery should simulate adaptive rate control"
echo "- Rate adjustments should be shown with timestamps and reasons"
echo "- Should demonstrate downshift due to high loss and recovery upshift"
echo "- Window statistics should track network performance"
echo
echo "DoD Check:"
echo "- ‚úÖ Loss rate monitoring implemented"
echo "- ‚úÖ Automatic rate downshift on high loss/timeouts"
echo "- ‚úÖ Gradual rate recovery after consecutive good windows"
echo "- ‚úÖ Time window statistics tracking"
echo "- ‚è≥ Full integration with real discovery engine pending"
